# Single-Cycle-Processor-Using-Verilog
This was an implementation of a function of single cycle processor which was implemented using Verilog.

The processor architecture and the ISA is very much similar to MIPS.

Along with the components of the CPU, Data memory, Data cache, Instruction memory and Instruction cache is also implemented.
